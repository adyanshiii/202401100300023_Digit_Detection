Digit Detection and Image Detection



This project focuses on digit detection and image detection using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The digit detection module leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately recognize handwritten digits from images or real-time webcam input. It preprocesses input data using OpenCV and classifies digits using a trained neural network. 


Meanwhile, the image detection module utilizes state-of-the-art object detection models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or Faster R-CNN to identify and localize multiple objects within an image. With support for real-time detection and configurable confidence thresholds, this project provides a robust solution for recognizing and classifying visual data efficiently. Ideal for applications in automation, security, and smart systems, this project demonstrates the power of AI in visual recognition tasks.
